# Streamdata.io Basic Demo Stock Market Prices Streaming API (Serverless)
This is a basic demo of delivering a Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream of stock market prices using Streamdata.io, that runs on AWS Lambda.

You will need a Streamdata.io account + key to run this function, as well as an AWS account to operate in.

You can run this as stream for up to five minutes, then rerun every five minutes using AWS Cloudwatch Events.

There is no destination for the data stream, it is just meant to demonstrate what is possible with a serverless stream.

Visit Streamdata.io for more information on our service, and submit an issue here if you need help with this package.
